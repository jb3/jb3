## Hi there, I'm Joe! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joe, a Computer Science student working primarily with Python, Rust and Elixir!

I spend most of my time working as an Owner at [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/), focusing mainly on our infrastructure and technology.

I'm starting Computer Science at University level this September!
